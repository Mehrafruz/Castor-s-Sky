Castor‚Äôs Sky ‚òîÔ∏è
Answering the age-old question: "Will it rain on my parade?"

Castor's Sky is a sophisticated iOS application that moves beyond simple weather forecasts. It combines live precipitation mapping with authoritative, long-term precipitation history from NASA, empowering users to make confident, data-driven decisions for any outdoor event.

‚ú® Features
Interactive Live Map - Tap anywhere on the MapKit-based map or search for any city to view current precipitation, temperature, wind, and a 24-hour forecast chart

Long-Term Rain Analysis - Get detailed historical view of daily precipitation and "rainy day" intensity for the past 7 to 90 days, sourced directly from NASA's hydrology services

Resilient Data Pipeline - Intelligent caching, exponential backoff retries, and automatic fallback system (NASA POWER ‚Üí Open-Meteo ERA5) to ensure data is always available

Event Planning Focus - Specifically designed to reduce the risk and anxiety of planning outdoor gatherings

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Highlights
Architecture & Technologies:

Platform: iOS 17+
